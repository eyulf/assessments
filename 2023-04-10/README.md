# DevOps Assessment

Using terraform to provision a stack on AWS that runs a nginx image and expose it to Internet.

**Requirements:**

1. The image should be running in a container orchestration software like ECS or EKS.
2. It should be publicly accessible.

Note: This is an open question so you have your chance to define:

1. Code structure
2. Security
3. AWS architecture

You donâ€™t need to provision resources on your AWS account.
